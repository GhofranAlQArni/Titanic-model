# Titanic-model
In this task, we will use machine learning to create a model that predicts whether passengers survived the infamous Titanic voyage. We will utilize the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the model and then evaluate its accuracy using a test dataset.


# steps :


1-Import Necessary Libraries: Import Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn libraries.

2-Read Data: Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.

3-Explore Data: Display some records, check for missing values, and understand the types of variables.

4-Data Processing: Handle missing values and convert categorical variables to numerical ones.

5-Select Variables: Identify the independent variables and the dependent variable.

6-Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

7-Train Model: Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.

8-Evaluate Model: Assess the model's accuracy using the test set and calculate the prediction accuracy.
